# Constructors
In this folder, you will find the following:
1. Constructors.java and .class
    - Will go over everything you need know about constructors. Project STEM used their own package called shapes, I attempt to recreate it to the best of my ability.
2. Rectangle.java and .class
    - My first recreation of the shapes package. Includes basic constructors for all 3 ways to create a rectangle, as shown in the package.
